This page shows how to add a new Eventing Function and briefly explores the Eventing Lifecycle.

[#eventing_lifecycle_image]

This is a quick introduction to Eventing via creating a simple Eventing Handler and subsequently exercising the Eventing 
Handler's functionality and operations across its typical lifecycle. For a deeper insight refer to the more detailed xref:eventing-examples.adoc[Eventing Examples].

*Prerequisites*: In order to show the basic life cycle of an Eventing Function, we need a Listen To Location (a source keyspace) and a seperate Eventing Storage keyspace.
You must have an Eventing storage keyspace, which shold be typically 100% resident, and the collection is to be used solely by the Eventing Service.

For the Listen To Location or source keyspace we will use the *beer-sample._default._default* sample document set. 

If you don’t already have the sample document set *beer-sample* (it should have a scope of _default and a collection of _default) listed in the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page you can load this sample data set as follows:

** Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Settings* page
** Select the *Sample Buckets* in the upper right banner. 
** Check *beer-sample* checkbox.
** Click *Load Sample Data*.

For the Eventing Storage keyspace we need to create one if missing as follows:

** Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page
** Select the *Add Bucket* in the upper right banner. 
** In the dialog set the "Name" of the bucket to *RR100* and set "Memory Quota" to *100* MiB.
** Click *Add Bucket*.

At this point we could use the Eventing Storage keyspace of _RR100._default._default_, for all eventing function but we might want to split this up by tenants as follows:

** Select *Scopes & Collections* at the right of the new bucket information line.
** Select the *Add Scope* in the upper right banner. 
** In the dialog set the "Name" of the Scope to *tenant01*.
** Click *Save*.
** Select *Add Collection* at the right of the new scope information line.
** In the dialog set the "Name" of the Collection to *metadata*.
** Click *Save*.

To add a new Eventing Function:

. From the Couchbase Web Console > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*.
+
An empty *ADD FUNCTION* dialog is shown:
+

[cols="50,173"]
|===
| *Elements* | *Description*

| Listen To Location (the source keyspace)
| The name of a collection currently defined on the cluster.

// TODO7X - need to check/fix this (buckets, scopes, collections)
For more information on creating buckets, scopes, and collections refer to xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].

| Eventing Storage (the Eventing metadata keyspace)
| The name of a collection currently defined on the cluster.
The Eventing Storage (or Metadata) collection, stores artifacts (or configuration documents) for your Function. Acommon Eventing Storage collection can be shared across all Eventing Functions for the same tenant.

// TODO7X - need to check/fix this (buckets, scopes, collections)
For more information on creating buckets, scopes, and collections refer to xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].

| Function Name
| A name, for the Function you are creating.
All Eventing Functions must have a unique name in a Couchbase cluster.

| Deployment Feed Boundary
| Using the Feed Boundary drop down, you can either set a handler to deploy for all data mutations available in the cluster (Everything) or choose to deploy the handler to process only future data mutations, post deployment (From now). The Feed Boundary is a persistent setting in the 
Function’s definition and can only be set or altered when a Function is created, undeployed or paused.

| Description
| The Description is an optional text that can be added to the Function, typically to describe the purpose of the particular business logic.
This is optional.

| Settings
a|
The available settings (by default hidden within a collapsible panel) for complete details refer to xref:eventing-Terminologies.adoc#function-settings[Terminologies - Function Settings]:

* *System Log Level*: Determines the granularity at which messages are logged to the common system log messages across all Eventing Functions. The available choices are: `Info` (the default), `Error`, `Debug`, `Warning`, and `Trace`. Leave this alone unless asked by support to change it.

* *Application log location* The directory path to the log file for the application or the Function specific log messages named <<function_name>>.log. 
The Function designer uses log() statments to write to this file in addition it will also record some Function specific system level errors.  
In the UI when "Log" is selected these files are combined across all Eventing nodes and displayed. This path is set at node initialization.

* *N1QL Consistency*: The default consistency level of N1QL statements in the handler.
This controls the consistency level for N1QL statements, but can be set on a per statement basis. The valid values are `None` (the default) and `Request`.

* *Workers*: Workers the number of worker processes to be started for the handler.
The minimum value is 1 (the default) and the recomended maximum is 64.

* *Language compatibility*: The language version of the handler for backward compatibility.
If the semantics of a language construct change in any given release the “Language compatibility” setting will ensure an older handler will continue to see the runtime behavior that existed at the time it was authored, until such behavior is deprecated and removed. Note 6.0.0, 6.5.0, and 6.6.2 (the default) are the only currently defined versions.

* *Script Timeout*: Script Timeout provides a timeout option to terminate a non-responsive Function.
The entry points into the handler, e.g. OnUpdate and OnDelete, processing for each mutation must complete from start to finish prior to this specified timeout duration. The default is 60 seconds.

* *Timer Context Max Size*: Timer Context Max Size limits the size of the context for any Timer created by the Function. 
Eventing Timers can store and access a context which can be any JSON document, the context is used to store state when the timer is created and retrieve state when the timer fires.  By default the size is 1024 bytes, but this can be adjusted on a per Function basis.

| Bindings
a|
A binding is a construct that allows separating environment specific variables (example: bucket names, external endpoint URLs, constants) from the handler source code.  Currently Eventing Functions support the follwing types bindings:

* *Bucket Bindings*: to access the Data Service or KV.

* *URL Bindings*: to communicate externally via cURL.

* *Constant Bindings*: to pass global settings/constants into the function.

An Eventing Function can have no bindings, just one binding, or several bindings. For more information on Bindings, refer to xref:eventing-Terminologies.adoc#section_mzd_l1p_m2b[Terminologies - Bindings].
|===

. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, configure the following information:
 ** For the *Listen To Location* drop-downs, select *beer-sample* for bucket, *_default* for scope, and *_default* for collection.  
 ** For the *Eventing Storage* drop-downs, select *RR100* for bucket, *tenant01* for scope, and *metadata* for collection.  
 ** Enter *my_evt_function* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *A simple Eventing Function only prints IDs*, in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values, feel free to expand and inspect.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, don't add any bindings (we will merely be logging messages).
+
image::addfunc_02_settings.png[,484]
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *my_evt_function* dialog appears.
** The *my_evt_function* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will accept the default for your *my_evt_function code*.
+
image::addfunc_03_editor_with_default.png[,100%]
** You will need to click *Save and Return* if you modified the JavaScript source.
** To return to the Eventing screen, click the '*< back to Eventing*' link (above the editor) or just click the *Eventing* tab.

. Click on the Function name.
+
image::addfunc_04_newundeployed.png[,100%]
Additional controls are now displayed. The controls are:
** *Delete*: Deletes the Eventing Function from the system.
** *Export*: Exports the Eventing Function as a JSON document.
** *Deploy*: Deploys the Eventing Function, making it active across the cluster.
** *Pause*: Pauses the Eventing Function, making it paused across the cluster (only allowed if the Function is Deployed).  If a Function is paused this button will be renamed *Resume*.
** *Edit JavaScript*: Allows edits to be made on the Eventing Function, in an edit dialog (only allowed when Paused or Undeployed).  When deployed this button is renamed *View JavaScript*.

. From the *Eventing* screen, click *Deploy*.
** In the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, note that *Everything* is the preferred *Feed boundary*.
+
The Feed Boundary determines whether documents previously in existence need to be included in the Function's activities: the options are *Everything* and *From now*.
The *Everything* option invokes a Function on all mutations available in the cluster from the *Listen To Location* keyspace.
The *From now* option invokes a Function during future instances of data mutation, post Function deployment or new changes to the *Listen To Location* keyspace.
The preferred Deployment Feed Boundary for the function can be changed under the function level settings when the Function is undeployed or paused.
+
** Click *Deploy Function*.

. While the Eventing function is bootstrapping it will display a status of "deploying..." in the UI. Once the botstrapping is complete the defined Function's JavaScript code is executed on all existing documents and then on subsequent mutations.  This function will only perform logging operations.
+
image::input-output-overview-6.5.png[,%100]
+
The deployment process typically takes about 15 seconds. Once the Eventing Function is fully deployed its status will change from *deploying...* to a status of *deployed*. At this point the Eventing service will quickly process all of the 7,303 items in the collection because the *Feed boundary* was set to *Everything* in the Function's settings.  Finially the Function will await any new mutations and immediately proccess them in real-time as they occur.
+
image::addfunc_05_deployed_done.png[,100%]
+
Since the example only has a single log(....) statement in the *OnUpdate* handler it will merely list items in the collection 'beer-sample', i.e. 7,303 documents.
+
You should see the success count at 7,303 in the Function's basic statistics.

. Verify that the deployment and processing actually worked by clicking the *Log* link that appeared after you the Eventing Function eached a status of deployed. The *Log* link appears in the right hand side of the Function's controls.
** A dialog showing the *Function Log - my_evt_function* will appear with the most recent logging information (in reverse order with the most recent lines first).
+
image::addfunc_06_logs_emitted.png[,100%]
** Click *Close*.

. To pause and resume a function (you can then edit and update the function without missing a mutation)  
** Click *Pause*.
** In the *Confirm Pause Function* dialog
*** Click *Pause Function*.
** The Eventing function will now creak a checkpoint of its progress and pause.
** Wait for the "paused" state.
** Click *Resume*.
** In the *Confirm Resume Function* dialog
*** Click *Resume Function*.
** The Eventing function will now resume from the previously created checkpoint (no mutations will be missed).

. To remove the Eventing Function *my_evt_function*  
** Click *Undeploy*.
** In the *Confirm Undeploy Function* dialog
*** Click *Undeploy Function*.
** The Eventing function will now undeploy.
** Wait for the "undeployed" state.
** Click *Delete*.
** In the *Confirm Delete Function* dialog
*** Click *Delete Function*.

NOTE: The Eventing Function lifecycle operations (deploying, undeploying, pausing, resuming, and deleting operations) and the Eventing rebalance operation *are mutually exclusive*. The Eventing rebalance operation fails when an Eventing Function lifecycle operation is currently in progress. Likewise, when the Eventing rebalance operation is in progress, you cannot perform an Eventing Function lifecycle operation.
